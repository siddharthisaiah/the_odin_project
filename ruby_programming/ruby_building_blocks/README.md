[Part of the Curriculum from the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks)

### Project 1 - Caeser Cipher

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

```
	> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
 	=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```

### Project 2 - Stock Picker

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days 
representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

```
> stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
=> [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```

### Project 3 - Substrings

 Implement a method `#substrings` that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as 
 the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how 
 many times it was found.

```
> dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]
=> ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]

> substrings("below", dictionary)
=> {"below"=>1, "low"=>1}
```

Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words:

```
> substrings("Howdy partner, sit down! How's it going?", dictionary)
=> {"down"=>1, "how"=>2, "howdy"=>1,"go"=>1, "going"=>1, "it"=>2, "i"=> 3, "own"=>1,"part"=>1,"partner"=>1,"sit"=>1}
```
